In order to increase awareness of technical work across the technology team, the Architecture team would like you to write an FYI for [{{fyiName}}]({{editLink}}).

An FYI is a very short description of new technical work addressing:
  - What are the project goals, in plain language, at a very high level?
  - Who is the main point of contact for the FYI?
  - Where can people look for further details?
  - When will the work happen?

If you'd like to see some examples, we have quite a few [here](https://cnissues.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARCH/pages/123212691/FYIs#FYIs-FYIlist). They are intended to be very quick and easy to write. TODO - Attached is also a video showing how to create one in Confluence.

Please reply to this issue and cc @johnkpaul & @gautamarora if you'd like to have a meeting to walk through how to do this. We can schedule something and show you pretty easily, if it would help.
