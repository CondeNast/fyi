# FYI Architecture Diagrams

Discover and Explore your Organization's System Architecture

## Introduction

The FYI application was built by the Architecture Team at Cond√© Nast to stay on top of their growing technology portfolio of systems (sites, apps, apis) distributed across hundreds of repositories in multiple GitHub organizations.

This application has two parts:

  - a Github App (called Arch Bot) for automated repository-based system discovery workflow
  - a Frontend App (called Easy FYI) for interactive architecutre diagrams with system dependencies and metrics
