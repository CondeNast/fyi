## ü§î Introduction

The FYI application was built by the Architecture Team at Cond√© Nast to stay on top of their growing technology portfolio of systems (sites, apps, apis) distributed across hundreds of repositories in multiple GitHub organizations.

This application has two parts:

  - a Github App to discover code repositories and request FYIs from developers
  - a Web App to view interactive architecture diagrams with system dependencies and metrics

### üî® Built Using

  1. Probot (Github App Framework)
  2. Create React App
  3. Postgres SQL
  4. Vault
  5. Integrations with: Confluence, Slack, Datadog

## üë®‚Äçüîß Install

### üîß Step 1: Setting Up Services
The goal of this step is to setup the required services for the FYI application, and populate the files in the `config` directory.

  1. Create a secrets file
      1. In your terminal, go to the `config` directory
      2. Run `cp secrets.json.example secrets.json`
  2. Create a web proxy url
      1. Go to `https://smee.io/`
      2. Start a new channel
      3. In `secrets.json`, copy this smee channel url as the value for `webhook-proxy-url`
  3. Create a Github Org
      0. _Note: In case you already have a organization, you can skip the next step_
      1. Go to `https://github.com/organizations/new` to start a new organization
      2. In `default.js`, add your org name to the `github.subscribedOrgs` list & `github.adminOrg`
  4. Create a Github App
      1. Go to `https://github.com/settings/apps/new` and create a new Github App
      2. Set `Webhook URL` to the webhook proxy url from above
      3. Set `Webhook secret` to `development`
      4. In `secrets.json`, copy the GitHub private key as the value for `github-private-key`
      5. Update your Github App's permissions:
          1. Read Only permission for: Repo Administration, Repo Metadata, Repo Webhooks, Commit Statuses, Org Members
          2. Read and Write permission for: Checks, Repository Contents, Issues, Pull Requests,
      6. Updates your Github Apps' event subscriptions:
          1. Subscribe to events for: Repository, Issues, Issue Comments
  5. Create a FYI Admin repository
      1. Go to `https://github.com/new` and create a new repository in your organization called `fyi-admin`
  6. Create a Confluence Space and Page
      1. TODO
  7. Configure Slack channel (optional)
      0. If you want to disable slack, update `default.js` for `slack.enabled` to be `false`
      1. Install "Incoming Webhooks" for your Slack instance
      2. Add a configuration for new incoming webhook for posting to your Slack channel
      3. In `secrets.json`, copy the Slack webhook url as the value for `slack-webhook-url`
      4. In `default.js`, set the channel name as value for `slack.channel`
  8. Configure Datadog events (optional)
      1. Not Supported - This integration has a very custom setup and is not currently supported.

### üèÉ Step 2: Running With Docker (recommended)

  0. Pre-requisites: Docker and Docker Compose
  1. Build Docker Image: `docker build -t easy-fyi-image .`
  2. Run Application: `docker-compose up`
  3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4001`

### üö∂ Running Without Docker

  0. Pre-requisites: Node v9+, Postgres SQL v10+
  1. Create database called `easy-fyi-development`
  1. `npm i`
  2. `npm run install:client`
  3. `npm start`
  4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3001`

## üöÄ Usage

### üÜï Creating a new FYI

There are 2 ways to create a new FYI:

    1. On the FYI homepage, click on the `New` button, add the FYI name and click `Submit`. This will create a FYI page for you to add dependencies, repositories and tags.
    2. If a new repository is created or identified, then the `Request FYI` command by Admins will create a new FYI.

### üîÄ Adding a Dependency to FYI

A dependency for a FYI can only be from a set of other existing FYIs.
A new dependency can be added through that FYI's detail page in the toolbar.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Adding a New Repository to FYI

When a new repository is created in the GitHub organization, the bot automatically detects it and sends a notification to the Admins who can choose to `Request a new FYI` or `Request to link to FYI` from the repository owner directly through Github issues.

### üàÅ Adding a Existing Repository to FYI

A request to add an existing repository can be submitted through the FYI's detail page in the toolbar. This triggers a notification to the Admins who can choose to pass the request to the repository owner or skip it.

### ‚èπ Adding a Tag to FYI

A new tag can be added through the FYI's detail page in the toolbar.

## üôè Thanks
