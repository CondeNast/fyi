## 🤔 Introduction

The FYI application was built by the Architecture Team at Condé Nast to stay on top of their growing technology portfolio of systems (sites, apps, apis) distributed across hundreds of repositories in multiple GitHub organizations.

This application has two parts:

  - a Github App to discover code repositories and request FYIs from developers
  - a Web App to view interactive architecture diagrams with system dependencies and metrics

### 🔨 Built Using

  1. Probot (Github App Framework)
  2. Create React App
  3. Postgres SQL
  4. Vault
  5. Integrations with: Confluence, Slack, Datadog

## 👨‍🔧 Install

### 🔧 Step 1: Setting Up Services
The goal of this step is to setup the required services for the FYI application, and populate the files in the `config` directory.

  1. Create a secrets file
      1. In your terminal, go to the `config` directory
      2. Run `cp secrets.json.example secrets.json`
  2. Create a web proxy url
      1. Go to `https://smee.io/`
      2. Start a new channel
      3. In `secrets.json`, copy this smee channel url as the value for `webhook-proxy-url`
  3. Create a Github Org

      1. Go to `https://github.com/organizations/new` to start a new organization
      2. In `default.js`, add your org name to the `github.subscribedOrgs` list & `github.adminOrg`
  4. Create a Github App
      1. Go to `https://github.com/settings/apps/new` and create a new Github App
      2. Set `Webhook URL` to the webhook proxy url from above
      3. Set `Webhook secret` to `development`
      4. In `secrets.json`, copy the GitHub private key as the value for `github-private-key`
      5. Update your Github App's permissions:
          1. Read Only permission for: Repo Administration, Repo Metadata, Repo Webhooks, Commit Statuses, Org Members
          2. Read and Write permission for: Checks, Repository Contents, Issues, Pull Requests,
      6. Updates your Github Apps' event subscriptions:
          1. Subscribe to events for: Repository, Issues, Issue Comments
  5. Create a FYI Admin repository
      1. Go to `https://github.com/new` and create a new repository in your organization called `fyi-admin`
  6. Create a Confluence Space and Page
      1. TODO
  7. Configure Slack channel (optional)
      0. If you want to disable slack, update `default.js` for `slack.enabled` to be `false`
      1. Install "Incoming Webhooks" for your Slack instance
      2. Add a configuration for new incoming webhook for posting to your Slack channel
      3. In `secrets.json`, copy the Slack webhook url as the value for `slack-webhook-url`
      4. In `default.js`, set the channel name as value for `slack.channel`
  8. Configure Datadog events (optional)
      1. Not Supported - This integration has a very custom setup and is not currently supported.

### 🏃 Step 2: Running With Docker (recommended)

  1. Build Docker Image: `docker build -t easy-fyi-image .`
  2. Run Application: `docker-compose up`
  3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4001`

### 🚶 Running Without Docker

  0. Pre-requisites: Node v9+, Postgres SQL v10+
  1. Create database called `easy-fyi-development`
  1. `npm i`

## 🚀 Usage

### 🆕 Creating a new FYI

There are 2 ways to create a new FYI:

    1. On the FYI homepage, click on the `New` button, add the FYI name and click `Submit`. This will create a FYI page for you to add dependencies, repositories and tags.
    2. If a new repository is created or identified, then the `Request FYI` command by Admins will create a new FYI.

### 🔀 Adding a Dependency to FYI

A dependency for a FYI can only be from a set of other existing FYIs.
A new dependency can be added through that FYI's detail page in the toolbar.

### ℹ️ Adding a New Repository to FYI

When a new repository is created in the GitHub organization, the bot automatically detects it and sends a notification to the Admins who can choose to `Request a new FYI` or `Request to link to FYI` from the repository owner directly through Github issues.

### 🈁 Adding a Existing Repository to FYI

A request to add an existing repository can be submitted through the FYI's detail page in the toolbar. This triggers a notification to the Admins who can choose to pass the request to the repository owner or skip it.

### ⏹ Adding a Tag to FYI

A new tag can be added through the FYI's detail page in the toolbar.
