## Introduction

The FYI application was built by the Architecture Team at Cond√© Nast to stay on top of their growing technology portfolio of systems (sites, apps, apis) distributed across hundreds of repositories in multiple GitHub organizations.

This application has two parts:

  - a Github App to discover code repositories and request FYIs from developers
  - a Web App to view interactive architecture diagrams with system dependencies and metrics
